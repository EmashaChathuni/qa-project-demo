# Root Cause Analysis: Database Performance Issue (QA-002)

## **Executive Summary**
Critical performance degradation discovered during load testing with Apache JMeter. Application response times increased from 50ms to 2000ms+ under moderate load (10 concurrent users), with error rates reaching 25%.

---

## **Problem Statement**

### **Incident Details**
- **Date Discovered**: September 30, 2025
- **Severity**: Major
- **Impact**: Application becomes unusable under concurrent load
- **Environment**: Development/Testing
- **Reporter**: Performance Testing Team

### **Symptoms Observed**
1. **Response Time Degradation**: 50ms â†’ 2000ms+
2. **Connection Timeouts**: HikariPool connection exhaustion
3. **Error Rate Increase**: 0% â†’ 25% under load
4. **Application Unresponsiveness**: Server stops responding to new requests

---

## **Root Cause Analysis Methodology**

### **Step 1: Problem Definition**
**5 Why Analysis:**
1. **Why** does the application fail under load?
   - Because database connections are not available
2. **Why** are database connections not available?
   - Because connection pool is exhausted
3. **Why** is the connection pool exhausted?
   - Because SQLite doesn't handle concurrent connections well
4. **Why** doesn't SQLite handle concurrency?
   - Because SQLite uses file-level locking (single writer)
5. **Why** are we using SQLite for concurrent applications?
   - Because it was chosen for simplicity during development

**Root Cause**: **Architecture Decision** - SQLite database inappropriate for concurrent access

---

## **Step 2: Technical Investigation**

### **Database Analysis**
```sql
-- SQLite Concurrency Limitations
-- âœ— Single writer at a time
-- âœ— Reader-writer lock conflicts  
-- âœ— File-level locking mechanism
-- âœ— No connection pooling optimization
```

### **Connection Pool Analysis**
```properties
# Default HikariCP Configuration (Insufficient)
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10        # Too small
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000    # Too short  
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=600000         # Default
spring.datasource.hikari.leak-detection-threshold=0  # Disabled
```

### **Load Test Results**
```
JMeter Test Configuration:
- Users: 10 concurrent
- Ramp-up: 30 seconds  
- Loops: 5 per user
- Total Requests: 100

Results:
- Success Rate: 75% (Expected: >99%)
- Avg Response Time: 1,847ms (Expected: <500ms)
- 95th Percentile: 2,934ms (Expected: <1000ms)
- Throughput: 3.2/sec (Expected: >20/sec)
```

## **Step 3: Contributing Factors**

### **Primary Cause**
ðŸŽ¯ **Database Architecture**: SQLite's single-writer limitation creates bottleneck

### **Secondary Causes**
1. **Connection Pool Misconfiguration**
   - Pool size too small for expected load
   - Timeout values insufficient for SQLite operations
   - No leak detection enabled

2. **No Performance Monitoring**
   - Missing connection pool metrics
   - No database performance logging
   - No early warning systems

3. **Testing Gap**
   - Performance testing not in CI/CD pipeline
   - Load testing performed too late in development cycle
   - No baseline performance benchmarks established

### **Environmental Factors**
- Development environment using production-inappropriate database
- No performance requirements defined during architecture phase
- Single-threaded database access not identified as risk

---

## **Step 4: Impact Assessment**

### **Business Impact**
- **User Experience**: Poor (application timeouts)
- **Scalability**: Severely limited (max 5-10 concurrent users)
- **Production Risk**: High (system failure under normal load)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Negative impact expected

### **Technical Impact**
- **System Reliability**: Compromised
- **Performance**: Unacceptable under load
- **Maintainability**: Database layer needs complete redesign
- **Testing**: Performance test suite needs expansion

---

## **Step 5: Solution Implementation**

### **Immediate Fix (Hotfix)**
```properties
# Emergency Connection Pool Tuning
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=5          # Reduced for SQLite
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=60000     # Increased timeout
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=300000          # Shorter idle time
spring.datasource.hikari.leak-detection-threshold=60000 # Enable leak detection
```

**Result**: Improves stability but doesn't solve root cause

### **Short-term Solution (Sprint 1)**
1. **Database Migration Planning**
   - Evaluate PostgreSQL vs MySQL
   - Design migration scripts
   - Plan data migration strategy

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   ```java
   // Add connection pool metrics
   @Component
   public class DatabaseMetrics {
       @Autowired
       private HikariDataSource dataSource;
       
       @EventListener
       public void logConnectionStats() {
           HikariPoolMXBean poolBean = dataSource.getHikariPoolMXBean();
           log.info("Active connections: {}", poolBean.getActiveConnections());
           log.info("Idle connections: {}", poolBean.getIdleConnections());
       }
   }
   ```

### **Long-term Solution (Sprint 2-3)**
1. **Database Migration**
   ```yaml
   # PostgreSQL Configuration
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/recipes
       username: ${DB_USER}
       password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
       hikari:
         maximum-pool-size: 20
         connection-timeout: 30000
         idle-timeout: 300000
   ```

2. **Performance Testing Integration**
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions - Performance Tests
   - name: Performance Test
     run: |
       mvn spring-boot:start
       jmeter -n -t performance-test.jmx -l results.jtl
       mvn spring-boot:stop
   ```

## **Step 6: Prevention Strategy**

### **Process Improvements**
1. **Architecture Review**
   - Mandatory performance review for database decisions
   - Scalability requirements definition phase
   - Technology choice validation with load projections

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Performance testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Load testing for every major release
   - Database performance benchmarking

3. **Monitoring Implementation**
   - Real-time database metrics
   - Connection pool monitoring
   - Performance alerting thresholds

### **Technical Improvements**
1. **Database Standards**
   ```markdown
   Database Selection Criteria:
   âœ… Concurrent connection support
   âœ… ACID compliance
   âœ… Backup and recovery
   âœ… Production scalability
   âœ… Performance monitoring tools
   ```

2. **Performance Requirements**
   ```markdown
   Application Performance SLA:
   - Response Time: <500ms (95th percentile)
   - Throughput: >100 requests/second
   - Concurrent Users: >50 simultaneous
   - Error Rate: <1% under normal load
   - Availability: >99.9% uptime
   ```

## **Step 7: Lessons Learned**

### **What Went Wrong**
1. **Technology Choice**: SQLite inappropriate for multi-user application
2. **Testing Gap**: Performance testing too late in development cycle
3. **Monitoring Gap**: No database performance visibility
4. **Requirements Gap**: Scalability requirements not defined

### **What Went Right**
1. **Early Detection**: Found in testing before production deployment
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Proper root cause investigation performed
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Both immediate and long-term fixes identified
4. **Documentation**: Thorough analysis and prevention strategy created

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Architecture Decisions Have Long-term Impact**: Choose technologies carefully
2. **Performance Testing is Critical**: Should be part of every sprint
3. **Monitoring is Essential**: Can't improve what you can't measure
4. **Documentation Helps**: Proper RCA prevents repeated mistakes

## **Step 8: Verification Plan**

### **Fix Validation**
1. **Immediate Fix Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test with improved connection pool settings
   jmeter -n -t load-test.jmx -l results-hotfix.jtl

   ```

### **Success Criteria**
- âœ… Error rate <1% under normal load
- âœ… 95th percentile response time <500ms
- âœ… Support 50+ concurrent users
- âœ… No connection pool exhaustion
- âœ… Performance monitoring in place

## **Conclusion**

This root cause analysis revealed that architectural decisions made early in development (choosing SQLite) had significant performance implications discovered only during load testing. The comprehensive analysis led to both immediate mitigation and long-term architectural improvements, along with process changes to prevent similar issues in the future.

**Key Success Factor**: Thorough investigation and multi-layered solution approach addressing immediate needs while planning for sustainable long-term fixes.
